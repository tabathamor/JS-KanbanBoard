## Create an Item

In this module we will add DOM event listeners to a Kanban Board. We will make it possible to add tasks, and drag and drop those tasks between columns.

To start, let's open the main file for the project, `js/kanban.js`.

Find the function called `create_item()`. In the body of this function, use the `createElement()` function to create a DOM element of type `div`. Save a reference to the element in a constant called `item`.

**Hint: when working with DOM elements, you will need to reference `document`.**

## Set Item Attributes

The `item` constant now stores a reference to a fully fledged DOM element. We can manipulate anything about this element. Below the existing code in the `create_item()` function, use the `add` method of the `classList` object to add the existing CSS class of `item` to the `item` element.

Next, give the `item` an `id` of `item-` plus the current value of `order`.

Finally, make the `item` `draggable`.

## dragstart Event Listener

Now that the `item` is `draggable`, add an event listener that listens for the `dragstart` event to `item`. When creating the event listener, pass an arrow function as the handler. The arrow function should accept a single parameter of `event`, and it should return a call to the `setData()` method. The `setData()` method is part of the `DataTransfer` object, which needs to be accessed through the `event`.

Use the `setData()` method to set `'text'` to the `id` of the `event.target` element.

## dragend Event Listener

After the `dragstart` event listener, add an event listener that listens for the `dragend` event to `item`.

When creating the event listener, pass an arrow function as the handler. The arrow function should accept a single parameter of `event`, and it should return a call to the `clearData()` method. The `clearData()` method is part of the `DataTransfer` object, which needs to be accessed through the `event`.

## Create input Element

Below the drag event listeners, use the `createElement()` method to create a DOM element of type `input`. Save a reference to the element in a constant called `input`.

Append this new `input` element to the `item` element with the correct DOM method.

## Create a Save Button

Below the `input` element, use the `createElement()` method to create a DOM element of type `button`. Save a reference to the element in a constant called `save_btn`.

Change the `innerHTML` property of the `save_btn` element to `Save`.

## Save Button Event Listener

We can now add an event listener to `save_btn`. Below the existing code, register an event listener for `save_btn` that listens for a `click` event. Pass an arrow function as the handler. The arrow function does not need to accept any parameters.

## Validate Input - if conditional

In the body of the `save_btn` event handler, set the HTML of the `error` element to an empty string.

Next, create an `if` statement that tests whether the `value` of `input` is not equal to an empty string.

## Validate Input - if body

Add three lines in the body of the `if` statement. The first should add `1` to `order` and reassign the value back to `order`. The second should change the HTML of the `item` element to the `value` of the `input`. The third should toggle `adding` to `false`.

## Validate Input - else body

Still in the `save_btn` handler, add an `else` statement to the existing `if` statement. In the body of this `else` statement, set the HTML of the `error` element to the `message` string.

## Append the Save Button

Now that all parts of the `save_btn` are complete, append it to the `item` element. With this `item` is now complete as well, return it from the `create_item()` function.

## Drop Event - Handler

Below the `create_item()` function, find the `forEach` loop. In the body, add an event listener that listens for the `drop` event to `element`. When creating the event listener, pass an arrow function as the handler. The arrow function should accept a single parameter of `event`.

To begin the event handler, prevent the default action of `event`.

## Drop Event - Data Transfer

Still in the `drop` event handler, get the data in `'text'` with the `getData()` method. The `getData()` method is part of the `DataTransfer` object, which needs to be accessed through the `event`. Store the returned value in a constant called `id`.

## Drop Event - Append Element

As the last line of the `drop` event handler, append the element that has an id of `id` to `event.target`. **Hint: use the `getElementById()` method of `document`.**

## Drag Event - Handler

Still in the `forEach()` loop function, add an event listener that listens for the `dragover` event to `element`. When creating the event listener, pass an arrow function as the handler. The arrow function should accept a single parameter of `event` and prevent the default action of `event`.
